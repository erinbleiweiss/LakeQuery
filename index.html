                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>Our site is inspired by popular click bait websites, like Buzzfeed and the Huffington Post, which use dynamic quizzes to engage users.  Lake Query satirizes the absurdity of these sensationalist viral news websites, and parodies them with satirical quizzes that are as meaningless as their own quizzes.</p>
                <p>This site tracks quiz results for individual users, and display results on a progresss page.  It also keeps track on the total amount of time spent on all quizzes.  The results page is also satirical, displaying suggestions on how a user might have better spent his time.</p>
                <p>So waste your time here at Lake Query!</p>
